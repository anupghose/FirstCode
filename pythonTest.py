'''A.2.list:
list is a collection of element
list enclosed with []
List follow indexing
list is a growable in nature
Tuple:
Tuple is a collection of element
it's enclosed with ()
it's follow indexing
it's not a growable in nature

'''

'''3.list.pop()
it will delete the last element of a list
 dic.pop()
 it will delete the last key and value of a dictionary

'''4.python memory managed by object creation,reference counting and garbage collection'''

'''5.split()
with the help of split function we can split string into a list by using delimeter

join()
it keeps element in a single string
'''
'''6.In python function is a unit where we can write logical entity
there are two types of function 
inbuilt function
user defind function'''

'''7.in python split does the split the element.'''
'''8.in python join does keeps element in a single string

'''9.In python private variable are wirtten using prefix underscore(_) look like _Var_
'''
'''10. In python protected variable are written using prefix double underscore(__) look like __var__'''
'''B.1.
In pytho logical operator are used only condition level
there are three type of logical operator
AND operator: It gives true result when both the condition of a logic are true otherwise it gives false

OR operator:It gives true result when one of the condition is true othewise it gives false
 NOT operator: it converts true into false and false into true
'''

'''2.In python there are 2types of membership operator
 in operator: it is used to check the value of a operator exist in  sequence or not

NOT IN: it is check the specific value of oprator not in the sequence'''
